	<p><strong><u>Sprint-4 (Final Sprint) description:</p></strong></u>
	<article> The final sprint was less rigorous from a deadline perspective than the other 3 sprints, as most of the final tasks were fixing bugs or refactoring error logic based on discussions in class. However, due to the volume of tasks that required completion, this sprint ended with the highest number of completed story points, but over a much longer period of time than the last 3 week-long sprints.

		The most complex portion of this sprint was implementing the A/B testing. The dev responsible initially pursued a method using javascript to alternate links to two alternate donate/support pages per event, which resulted in numerous failed tests and code errors. Another dev found the Google Optimize tool within google analytics and passed it off to the previous dev as a potential option. After learning how to enable the tool, the dev implemented Google Optimize to the main branch and commenced the experiment for the alternate donate/support. A more in depth explanation of how this was achieved is below.

		We also fixed multiple bugs in this sprint. The largest fix was to the RSVP logic, which originally was managed by a separate controller. We moved the functionality within Event Controller, whenever a POST request from the page is invoked.

		We also performed a code review to ensure that the code follows Uber Go style guide. To ensure this, we ran golint and made all changes recommended by the linter. During code review, we found several opportunities to optimize the code further - we removed unnecessary code duplication, modularized the code, and simplified the flow.

	<p><u><strong>Traffic Analysis</u></p></strong>
	<p> We used Google Analytics to monitor traffic to our website. The traffic that we observed on our application was:

	<img alt="" src="/Sprint-Reports/images/traffic.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 385.33px;" title="Chart">
	<p>The distribution from the various sources can be summarized by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>44.67% of the traffic was acquired from divinity.yale.edu</li>
		<li>35.01% of the traffic was acquired from search.yale.edu</li>
		<li>11.4% of the traffic was acquired from som.yale.edu</li>
		<li>8.92% of the traffic was acquired from medicine.yale.edu&nbsp;</li>
		<li>0% of the traffic was acquired from law.yale.edu</li>

	<p><u><strong>A/B Test Result</u></p></strong>

	<p> We used Google Optimize within Google Analytics to conduct the A/B test. Google Optimize was enabled with a javascript header that linked the Optimize experiment with the website. Due to limitations of the program, we only conducted this A/B test on Events 1, 3, and 4, by changing the text from “support” (Original) to “donate” (Variant 1). The experiment tracked the number of users who ended at a donation page linked to each event by alternating the text that users saw with a 50/50 split. This test ran for a total of 8 days with approximately 1200 observations from the various user visits. As of December 13th 2022, event pages with the link text <strong>“Donate”</strong> got <strong>8.03% conversion</strong>, whereas  pages with link text <strong>“Support”</strong> got <strong>3.40% conversion</strong>. From this A/B test, we can conclude with a 99% confidence interval that “Donate” is the better choice.

	<p><strong><u>Conclusion:</p></strong></u>
	<article> Over the past few months, our team has worked effectively as a unit, and we found that working in sprints with a rotating PM worked very well for us. We grew comfortable with version control using Github, and learnt to use Github issues to track every single feature or bug that we worked on. We initially used branches sparingly - but as our familiarity with Github/VSCode/Heroku grew, we began to branch out often and merge often into the dev and main branches (practicing CI/CD). We also learnt a lot about how Google Analytics and Optimize work.

		<br>
	<article> We have learnt an immense lot from this project, and would like to thank Prof. Kyle Jensen for including such a fun practical element to MGT 660.
