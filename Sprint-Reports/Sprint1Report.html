	<article>On Wednesday (10/26), all four of us met in person at a breakout room in Evans. Given that we had a time crunch, we quickly identified the overall theme of the project and the line items to focus on for the first sprint. We decided to focus on setting up the codebase and infrastructure first, and get a basic structure in place by Sprint 1. The PM for the week (Nithin) curated the most important stories, and we selected the tasks to complete individually for our first sprint.</article>

	<article>After the meeting, we continued coordinating through slack messages. Many of us encountered issues with auto deployment as we did not have admin authorization during the first few days of Sprint 1. This meant we initially deployed the codes manually on Heroku. By day 5, we received the admin access and turned on the automatic deploy feature. We were then able to complete all the selected stories in our individual branches and then merge them to the main branch. We now have a structure in place, and will continue to build on this in the next sprint.</article>

	<p><u>Product Backlog</p></u>
	<ol>
    <li>CSS framework for Homepage</li>
    <li>About page contains nicknames (team and individuals)</li>
    <li>Event detail page has links</li>
    <li>API exists</li>
    <li>Page for creating a new event has a form for submitting a new event</li>
	</ol>
	<p><br></p>
	<p>We will continue our communication on the final contents of sprint 2 over slack. We also plan to focus on all of the items above. We have a separate excel sheet in which we identified the longer-term objectives (which will be progressively adjusted and shared in the subsequent sprint reports). Our product owner will discuss our strategies as to how to improve on the preexisting framework for our pages as well as the best practices to incorporate the API.</p>
