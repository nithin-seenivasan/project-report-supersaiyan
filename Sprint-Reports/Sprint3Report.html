	<p><strong><u>Sprint-3 description:</p></strong></u>
	<article> Our sprint-3 started on Wednesday (11/9), where all four of us met after class both in person and using Zoom (one of the devs had a fever and so had to call in virtually). We realized that during our last sprint, we were slightly behind what we aimed for, and so during this sprint we targeted a bit more reasonable points (39 points in total). Some of the issues from Sprint 2 that were not complete or needed to be further improved were brought up and communicated.

	<! -- This section is for the Paragraph 2 of description -->
	<article>After the meeting on 11/9, we continued communicating through Slack. Two of the devs had an issue with deployment to heroku and one had trouble with the controller but was able to resolve the issue after communicating with the team. The most complicated portion of this sprint was API but with consistent effort, the dev was able to make it work. On Monday (11/14), we met in-person again and discovered that our app failed in Prod. After selectively reverting some pieces of the project, we believe we accidentally created a circular reference by one dev merging Main into the Development branch and merging Development back into Main. We’re still not entirely sure how it happened, but were able to return the code to its original state and merge properly. By 11/16, we created more issues on Github in order to more closely reflect what we had worked on. </article>

	<! -- This section is for the Paragraph 3 of description -->
	<article>Once all the work was completed (we have been working on the development branch), we merged all the story points to main and marked them as complete. As the devs worked independently, we addressed merge conflicts as well. Utilizing the feedback we received in our previous sprints, we worked on our acceptance criteria more carefully and closed the relevant issues. To enhance the learning process for two more junior devs, we elected to leave the final merge to main for our last meeting which is also when we closed the associated issues in GitHub. We recognize that this is not the usual Agile process, but believe it is required for our team to learn about some of the more difficult portions of the project. As a placeholder for the junior devs to learn, we used the dev branch as a replicant of main so that those devs could merge freely without affecting the main branch, however, since our burnup chart only shows main, it looks as though we did all our work in the last bit of the sprint again. Upon closer inspection of our merging habits (Figure 1) the dev team as a whole is getting more comfortable with merges and is submitting code more frequently and in smaller batches.</article>

	<article>Our plan moving forward is to integrate the lessons learned from our three sprints and integrate them into future work that is focused on smaller, more manageable parts. We believe we’ve established a good tempo for working and merging and each dev has a good understanding of their own capabilities. Our next large milestones are integrating analytics, implementing testing, and smoothing out the UI presentation.</article>

	<! -- This section is for the Conclusion -->
	<p><strong><u>Conclusion and Next Steps:</p></strong></u>
	<p>We plan to use the lessons learned from all three sprints (described in the sprint description paragraphs above) to all future work. Once we have a functional web app that fulfills all the minimum requirements (a MVP), we plan to start integrating analytics and start focusing on the UI. We also plan to conduct a code audit in the next few weeks to make sure we are following all the best practices and frameworks.</p>
